The `aria-label` attribute is used to define an accessible label for a button element specifically for assistive technologies like screen readers. This helps users who rely on screen readers understand the function of the button.

Here's a breakdown of how `aria-label` works:

## Default behavior: 

By default, the text content within the \<button> tags acts as the button's label for screen readers.

## Using `aria-label`: 
When you include `aria-label` within the button tag, the value you provide within the quotes becomes the accessible label for screen readers, overriding the default behavior. This is useful when the button text itself might be ambiguous or doesn't clearly convey the button's action.
Here's an example:

```HTML
<button>Click me</button>  <button `aria-label`="Submit this form">Submit</button>
```

## **Key points to remember:**

- Use `aria-label` only when there's no visible text label for the button. If you have text within the button that clearly describes its function, you don't need `aria-label`.
- For buttons with visible text labels, use `aria-labelledby` instead. This attribute references the ID of another element on the page that acts as the button's label.
- Keep `aria-label` text concise and descriptive, accurately reflecting the button's action.
