# connect-flash

## Purpose: 
Connects Express.js session flash messages to React components.
## Functionality:
- Uses Express.js middleware to store temporary messages in the session.
- Provides React components with a way to access and display these messages.
- Messages are typically cleared after a single page view.
## Pros:
- Tight integration with Express.js sessions.
- Simple setup for basic flash message functionality.
## Cons:
- Relies on Express.js sessions, which might not be present in all React applications.
- Limited styling options out of the box.
- Flash messages are cleared after a single page view, which can be inconvenient if you want them to persist for longer.
# react-hot-toast

## Purpose: 
A standalone, lightweight library for displaying customizable toast notifications in React applications.
## Functionality:
- Offers various toast types (success, error, warning, etc.) with customizable appearance.
- Allows configuring toast duration, position, and animations.
- Doesn't require Express.js sessions.
## Pros:
- More flexibility and customization than connect-flash.
- Works with React applications without Express.js.
Supports various toast types and configuration options.
## Cons:
- Requires separate installation and configuration compared to connect-flash (which leverages existing Express.js setup).
# Choosing Between connect-flash and react-hot-toast:

- If you're already using Express.js sessions and need a simple way to display basic flash messages, connect-flash might be a suitable choice.
- If you prefer more control over appearance, behavior, and integration with React components, opt for react-hot-toast. This is especially true if your React application isn't built on top of Express.js.
