There are several `transform` utility classes available in Tailwind CSS, not just for translation. Here's a breakdown:

- __Translation__: These classes move elements along the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes using the `translate` property. You can also `translate` along the z-axis (depth).
- __Scale__: These classes `scale` elements up or down using the `scale` property.
- __Rotation__: These classes `rotate` elements using the `rotate` property.
- __Skew__: These classes `skew` elements horizontally or vertically using the `skew` property.
- _Other Transformations_: Tailwind CSS also offers utilities for opacity, `transform` origin, and hardware acceleration.
