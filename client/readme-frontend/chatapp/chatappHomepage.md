# The homepage of a chat app UI typically focuses on two main things:

## Conversation List: 
This is the core element and will likely take up most of the screen. It displays a list of your ongoing chats, usually showing the name or profile picture of your contacts, a snippet of the latest message, and potentially a notification indicator for unread messages.

## Start a New Chat:  
There's often a prominent button or section dedicated to initiating new conversations. This might involve searching for contacts, creating groups, or quickly jumping into a new chat.

## Beyond these essentials, some chat apps may also include:

- Search Bar: For quickly finding specific contacts or chats.
- Profile Section: A quick way to access your profile settings or user information.
- Recent Activity: A glimpse into the latest messages across all your chats.
