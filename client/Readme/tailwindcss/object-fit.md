In CSS, the `object-fit` property controls how an image or video (replaced elements) resizes to fit its container.  There are several options for `object-fit`, but the one you're interested in is cover.

Here's what `object-fit`: cover does:

- Resizes the image to fill the container: The image will be scaled to cover the entire area of its container element.
- Maintains aspect ratio: Unlike fill, which can distort the image, cover preserves the original aspect ratio of the image.
- Cropping might occur: If the container's aspect ratio doesn't match the image's aspect ratio, parts of the image may be cropped to ensure it fills the container while maintaining the aspect ratio.
>This is a useful property for ensuring that images always fill their container element without being stretched or distorted.
