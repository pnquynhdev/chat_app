# tabIndex={0}

- This attribute is used in HTML to control whether an element can be focused using the keyboard or not, and subsequently participate in tab navigation.
- By setting tabIndex={0}, you're making the element focusable. This means a user can press the Tab key on their keyboard to move focus to that element, allowing them to interact with it using the keyboard (e.g., typing text into an input field, activating a button).
- The value 0 is the default for tabIndex and indicates that the element can be focused in the normal tab order along with other focusable elements on the page.
