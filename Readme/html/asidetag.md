# The `aside` tag in HTML 
The `aside` tag in HTML is used to indicate a section of a webpage that is tangentially related to the main content. You can think of it as additional information that enhances the main content but isn't crucial to understanding it.

Here's a breakdown of the `aside` tag:

## Purpose:

- Marks up a section of content that is indirectly related to the main content.
- Often used for sidebars or call-out boxes.
## How it works:

- The `aside` tag itself doesn't have a special visual presentation by default. You can style it using CSS.
- Content within the `aside` tag can be paragraphs, lists, quotations, or anything that complements the main content.
## Things to avoid:

- Don't use `aside` for parenthetical text, as that's part of the main flow.
- The content within `aside` should be somewhat relevant to the surrounding content.
## Example:

Imagine a news article about a new scientific discovery. You can use the `aside` tag to provide a brief biography of the lead scientist who made the discovery. This information is interesting but not essential for understanding the news itself.

Here's a basic example of how the `aside` tag might be used:

```HTML
<h1>New Scientific Discovery!</h1>
<p>Scientists have made a breakthrough in the field of...</p>

<`aside`>
  <h2>Dr. Jane Doe - A Leading Researcher</h2>
  <p>Dr. Doe is a renowned scientist who has been...</p>
</`aside`>

<p>Continuing with the main content of the article...</p>
