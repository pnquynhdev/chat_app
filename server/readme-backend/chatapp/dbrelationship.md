# Explaining the relationship between the Conversation, User, and Message models:


|Model|Description|Relationship|
|:---------|:--------|:-------|
|User|Represents a user of the chat application.|- One User can participate in many Conversations (Many-to-Many).|
|Conversation|Represents a chat thread between two or more users.|- One Conversation can have many Messages (One-to-Many). - A Conversation has many Participants (Many-to-Many) who are Users.|
|Message|Represents a single message sent within a Conversation.|- One Message belongs to one Conversation (One-to-Many). - One Message is sent by one User (One-to-Many).|

# Additional Notes:

- The `Many-to-Many` relationship between `User` and `Conversation` is achieved through the participants field in the Conversation model. This field is an array that stores references (ObjectIds) to User documents.
- A single Conversation can have multiple Users as participants, and a single User can participate in multiple Conversations.
- The Message model connects to both Conversation and User models using references.
    - The conversation field in the Message model stores the ObjectId of the Conversation it belongs to.
    - The sender field in the Message model stores the ObjectId of the User who sent the message.
# Benefits of this Relationship:

- This structure allows efficient data retrieval. You can easily fetch all messages in a conversation, along with the sender information for each message.
- It `simplifies adding new participants to conversations` or retrieving all conversations a user is involved in.
