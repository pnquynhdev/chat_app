For a clear and user-friendly chat app sign-in page, username, email, and password are a good foundation, but you can simplify it further and offer an alternative sign-in method. Here's what you can consider:

- Reduce Complexity:

    - __Prioritize Email or Username__: People tend to remember emails better. Consider using just email for sign-in, with the option to add a username later in their profile.
- Alternative Sign-In:

    - __Social Login__: Allow users to sign in with existing social media accounts like Google or Facebook. This saves them time and eliminates the need to remember another password.
- Additional Considerations:

    - __Remember Me__: Provide a checkbox for "Remember Me" to store login credentials securely on the user's device for future access.
    - __Forgot Password__: Include a clear link for users to reset their password if they forget it.
    
By focusing on a single sign-in method (email or username) and offering an alternative (social login), you can keep your sign-in page clear and user-friendly while still providing flexibility.
