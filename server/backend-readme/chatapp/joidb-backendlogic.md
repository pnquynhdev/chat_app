You're right, there might seem like a redundancy between the `if` (password !== confirmPassword) {...}` check and Joi's validation using `ref`. Here's a breakdown of why both approaches are useful:

## 1. JOI Schema Validation (using `ref`):

- Joi schema validation happens on the server-side before the code reaches your specific `if` statement. It enforces data integrity and prevents requests with mismatched passwords from reaching your backend logic. This improves data quality and avoids potential errors during user registration.
## 2. Explicit Check (using `if`):

- The `if (password !== confirmPassword) {...}` check can serve as an additional layer of validation, especially for client-side user experience. It can provide immediate feedback to the user `if` their passwords don't match during form submission. This improves the user experience by catching errors early on and preventing the user from submitting a form with mismatched passwords.
# Here's an analogy:

Imagine a bank requiring two signatures on a check. The bank form itself might have a section where both signatures need to match (similar to Joi validation), but the teller might also visually compare them before accepting the check (similar to the `if` statement check). Both steps contribute to ensuring the validity of the transaction.

# In summary:

- Joi validation with `ref` _enforces data integrity on the server-side_.
- The `if` statement check _improves user experience by providing immediate feedback on password mismatch_.

Both approaches work together to create a more robust and user-friendly registration process. You can choose to keep both for added security and a better user experience, or potentially remove the `if` statement `if` you're confident in Joi's validation on the server-side.
